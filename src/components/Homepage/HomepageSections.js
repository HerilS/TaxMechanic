                <p className="S2Para">“I have had an excellent experience working with the Tax Mechanic to get my taxes under control. I had not filed for a number of years, and the guilt of not doing so was weighing me down. Fortunately after a quick call with David, one of the co-founders, everything was set up and dealt with quickly and professionally. I am so happy that they have taken care of my tax headache for me. I highly recommend their services!”
