Revenue Canada has adapted, and I am proud to say for the better. Thousands of CRA officers have volunteered to take calls from worried taxpayers trying to apply for various emergency benefit programs. These officers are Canadians first, employees second, and are averaging forty calls a day. Makes me damn proud to be a Canadian!\n            What does this mean for you?

Here are five reasons why you should file now;</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Revenue Canada has suspended collection action.</li>\n                <li>You do not have to pay tax debts for six months.</li>\n                <li>Revenue Canada is focusing on CERB and helping Canadians.</li>\n                <li>Negotiations resulting in more favourable outcomes.</li>\n                <li>Tax Mechanic is offering flexible payment options.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <span>A fast-changing job</span>\n            <p>\n                Remember the days when you had to listen to two minutes of dial-up noises to connect to the internet? Even checking your email was such a hassle. Nowadays, we can be online with literally only the tip of our fingertips. Just tap our phones and voila–we have access to the internet and the gazillions of apps and web services associated with it.\n                Accompanying this drastic change in &#40;and need for&#41; technology over the last couple of decades, the role of a tax professional has evolved significantly. It’s no longer just blindly producing tax returns all day long. The daily challenges that a tax professional encounters have become much more multidimensional: constantly solving complex problems, keeping up to date with new technologies and methodologies, while also staying innovative and ethical.\n                At the Tax Mechanic, we know what taxpayers want. Our mission is to empower them to learn how to file, without friction or penalties, no matter their educational or professional background. By listening to the needs of our community of five thousand taxpayers since 1985, we’ve come to fully understand what drives them.\n                Are you part of the “hidden economy?”\n                <br/> <br/>\n                Recently the CRA won a court decision forcing a roofing supply company to give over customer records. The federal agency uses data to fight tax evasion in the construction sector. The Canada Revenue Agency &#40;CRA&#41; can compel a third party to divulge information about its customers, according to a decision released earlier this week by the Federal Court of Appeal &#40;FCA&#41; In Roofmart Ontario Inc. V Canada &#40;National Revenue&#41;, the appellant, Roofmart, a supplier of roofing and building materials, lost its appeal of a Federal Court decision granting a request by the CRA to impose an order on Roofmart to disclose customer information. The request is colloquially known as an “unnamed persons requirement” &#40;UPR&#41; under the Income Tax Act &#40;ITA&#41;. <br/>\n                In recent years, the CRA has made it a greater priority to target the “hidden economy” by dedicating more resources toward combatting non-compliance. According to an Ontario Ministry of Labour study cited in the decision, 28% of the construction industry’s economic activity was unreported or underreported, and as much as one-fifth of residential construction takes place unreported. <br/>\n                The CRA made an UPR application targeting Roofmart customers who spent $20,000 or more between 2015 and 2017, and $10,000 or more in the first six months of 2018.\n                Justice Rennie granted the UPR, determining that the conditions needed had been satisfied.\n                The Minister sought the following information related to the group of persons described above: <br /> <br />\n                a&#41; The Customers’ legal name, business or operating name, contact person, business address, postal code, and all telephone numbers on file; <br />\n                b&#41; The Customers’ business number, if known; <br/>\n                c&#41; The Customers’ itemized transaction details including invoice date, invoice number, total sale amount, method of payment, and address of delivery; and <br />\n                d&#41; All bank account information for the Customers &#40;including transit, institution, and account numbers&#41; from credit applications and/or otherwise maintained by Roofmart in its records. <br /> <br />\n                Justice Rennie concluded; <br />\n                “I do not accept this limitation on the discretion of the Court to grant a UPR. Canada has a system of self-assessment and self-reporting of income. It depends on the integrity and honesty of taxpayers to be fair and efficient &#40;R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd., &#91;1990&#93; 1 S.C.R. 627 at 636&#41;. Parliament has granted the Minister corresponding powers to verify and test compliance. These powers lie at the heart of the Minister’s ability to enforce taxation legislation. The broader public interest in the enforcement of our system of taxation outweighs the appellant’s private and commercial interests in not disclosing its clients’ personal information &#40;eBay Canada Limited v. Canada &#40;National Revenue&#41;, 2008 FCA 141 at para. 39 &#40;eBay II&#41;&#41;. This Court’s response in eBay I to similar policy arguments regarding taxpayer privacy bears repeating here &#40;eBay I at para. 67&#41;:\n                In a self-reporting system of taxation, “&#91;t&#93;axpayers have a very low expectation of privacy in their business records relevant to the determination of their tax liability” &#40;Redeemer Foundation v. Canada &#40;Minister of National Revenue&#41;, 2008 SCC 46 at para. 25&#41; and a requirement “provides the least intrusive means by which effective monitoring of compliance with the Income Tax Act can be effected” &#40;R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd., supra at 649&#41;.”<br/><br/>\n\n                In 2017, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled against hardware giant Rona in another UPR initiated by the CRA. Rona sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, but the leave was denied.\n                    <br /><br/>\n                Read the case brief here.\n                    <br/><br/>\n                My experience has been that a lot of entrepreneurs get into trouble by not maintaining their accounting records and as a result they fall behind on their taxes. Is that you? If so, you have options. First, hire a professional. Second, file a Voluntary Disclosure Application.\n            </p>\n            <span>The Voluntary Disclosure Application Process</span>\n            <p>The Voluntary Disclosures Program &#40;VDP&#41; gives you a second chance to correct a tax return you previously filed or to file a return that you should have filed. If you file a VDP application and it is accepted by the Canada Revenue Agency &#40;CRA&#41; you will have to pay the taxes owing, plus interest in part or in full. However, you would be eligible for relief from prosecution and, in some cases, from penalties that you would otherwise be required to pay.\n            At the Tax Mechanic we handle the whole process for you seamlessly. The first step is filing an RC199. Then we prepare your returns and draft a strategy for repayment. Revenue Canada will assess your returns and voila, you are up to date. You don’t have to visit a brick and mortar tax shop or talk to any annoying CRA officers. <br/>\n            Through the VDP, taxpayers can make an application to correct inaccurate or incomplete information, or to disclose information not previously reported. For example, taxpayers may not have met their tax obligations if they claimed ineligible expenses, failed to remit source deductions, did not file an information return, or underreported their income.\n            Effective March 1, 2018, VDP applications relating to income tax disclosures may fall into one of two tracks: <br />\n            The first track is a General Program. If accepted under the VDP, these applications will be eligible for penalty relief and partial interest relief. <br />\n            The second track is a Limited Program. Applications that disclose non-compliance where there is an element of intentional conduct on the part of the taxpayer or a closely related party will be processed under this Limited Program and if accepted, will receive reduced relief under the VDP.\n            The VDP promotes compliance with Canada’s tax laws by encouraging taxpayers to voluntarily come forward and correct any previous errors or omissions in their tax affairs. If a VDP application is accepted by the CRA, taxpayers will have to pay the taxes owing, plus interest in part or in full. However, taxpayers would be eligible for relief from prosecution and, in some cases, from penalties that they would otherwise be subject to under the legislation. <br />\n            The Minister is not required to grant relief in respect of all applications made to the VDP. Each request will be reviewed and decided on its own merits. In exercising discretion, the Minister is guided by principles of procedural fairness which require decisions to be made in good faith, in a manner that promotes the objects of the ITA. This information circular provides general guidelines on some of the relevant considerations in the exercise of this discretion. If relief is denied, the CRA will provide the taxpayer with an explanation of the reasons for the decision. In such cases, relief of arrears interest and any penalties payable may be requested and considered in accordance with the taxpayer relief provisions as described in IC 07-1R1, Taxpayer Relief Provisions.</p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P1() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>Are you behind several years on filing your taxes?</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\"February 14, 2020\" title=\"Are you behind several years on filing your taxes?\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson and Christa Lazar\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>You may think you are uniquely alone in this situation, but you are not. Falling years behind taxes is more common than you think, due to health, family, loss of work and other issues. As the years go by, the situation gets worse. Pressure and fear builds up, and since it seems there is no good solution at this point, and either way, it will have negative repercussions on your life, you keep postponing dealing with the issue, so it becomes a ticking time bomb that will affect your peace of mind, productivity, and health in the long term. We are analyzing the most common responses to these problems and their consequences:</p>\n            <span>1. OSTRICH DEFENSE</span>\n            <p>The most common response is denial. You pretend you don’t see the problem so the problem won’t see you. You think you can do nothing and hope they never find you. Fear paralyzes you. You hide your head in the sand and pray that the CRA will somehow forget that you exist. They won’t forget about you and like in the wild, this strategy never works out too well for the ostrich.</p>\n            <span>2. DIY: DO IT YOURSELF</span>\n            <p>You’re smart, surely you have enough knowledge and understanding of taxes to do it yourself. You muster your strength, take a sabbatical from work and family. You bury yourself in your cave, gather 10 years of tax returns and calculate your liability. Then file in a batch and wait, praying you haven’t made a mistake to make things worse.  The inevitable call from Revenue Canada’s friendly audit division comes in to scrutinize your past 10 years in minute detail.  A seemingly endless and unreasonable ordeal starts. Once it’s over you’ve aged 10 years. Time to pay your back taxes plus huge penalties for repeat non-filing. It’s now too late to regret this decision.</p>\n            <span>3. TAX LAWYER: BRING CASH, LOTS OF IT</span>\n            <p>After years of insomnia due to the subconscious pressure of unfiled taxes, a friend refers you to a good tax lawyer and suddenly you become hopeful. You meet up with the friend’s friend, a kind and likable character who claims to be able resolve all your tax problems. You kind of like him until he quotes you on his hourly rate of $600 and a retainer payable on the spot that starts from $3,500. You are secretly hoping that he works fast and your retainer will cover it all. Lawyers are not known for rushing though, in fact, they like to work slo-mo and compete with their pet snail in taking their time. They always win, too. At the end of the months-long process, you are faced with a $38,965 lawyers bill in addition to back taxes, penalties, and interest.</p>\n            <span>THE BEST ALTERNATIVE</span>\n            <p>The Tax Mechanic is your emergency response unit: make one phone call and let us do it for you: problem solved.

I also deal with evasion, forgetfulness, procrastination, and a whole host of other human behaviours. But it’s the fear that often gets people calling us – and which my biz partner David Harris and I at Tax Mechanic try to address and take care of right up front.\n            <br /><br />\n            First, there’s a simple fear of filing taxes, something that can become paralyzing – and can come with many excuses. Here’s an interesting New York Times article (10 years old, but timeless): https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/weekinreview/12delafuente.html\n            <br /><br />\n            For many people one year can turn into two years of non-compliance, then three years, five or ten or more. The fear of filing now becomes a fear that gets you into hiding, and fear of being found out, fined, or even imprisoned.\n            <br /><br />\n            Other clients have spoken about things like holding back on updating a resume or refusing well-paid work they need, fearing it will bring them out into the relentless spotlight of the CRA. It’s safer to stay below the radar, these people think. For some who haven’t filed for years, their terror can also be triggered by hearing a cop car or seeing a pile of tax forms at the post office.\n            <br /><br />\n            More than one client has told us that they’d torture themselves by looking at the CRA’s online ‘directory’ of province-by-province cases where a taxpayer was convicted in court for tax evasion. That includes the amount of the fines and the length of jail time some have. Many people also fear someone finding out and reporting them to the CRA tax evaders’ snitch line (or of being blackmailed).\n            <br /><br />\n            And as we know well, the CRA scams, those phony calls threatening to send law enforcement to your door to arrest you, generate a lot of fear – not only with recent immigrants and other vulnerable groups. Even smart, sophisticated people can fall for the tax scam.\n            <br /><br />\n            I’ve had some clients who’ve told me they knew all about those tax scams but were still rattled to get one of those calls at a certain time. For one client, it was a combination of that, and seeing that someone in administration at the CRA had looked at his LinkedIn profile. That was the push that got him to call us, and begin the process of facing that fear and resolving the situation.\n            <br /><br />\n            I’m no psychologist or psychiatrist, and I wouldn’t dream of trying to analyze someone’s fear and feelings. You might well find it of benefit to see a therapist if you’re finding it difficult to cope and go on. What we at Tax Mechanic can do is help you face and erase your fear in a very practical way – by clearing up your tax problem. At Tax Mechanic we can help you get back on track and back within the CRA fold. And even if you owe a lot of money, we can help you with a workable arrangement and payment plan with the CRA, so doing your taxes doesn’t leave you in the poorhouse.\n            <br /><br />\n            And as we also offer a free initial consultation, you can contact us if you’ve had one of those ‘CRA’ calls, messages, texts or emails. We can help set your mind at rest, and determine whether it’s a scam. Here’s what the CRA themselves say:\n            https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/protect-yourself-against-fraud.html\n            <br /><br />\n            You may find your fear dwindling as soon as you realize you have professional help to handle your problem for you, and to represent you so you don’t have to worry any longer. You might ultimately discover you don’t owe as much as you’d feared, or don’t owe any, and/or have some nice refunds coming back.\n            <br /><br />\n            Whatever your situation, you may also find, once you get your taxes done, you can do so many other things – now that you’re no longer in hiding. Here’s the thing, though – you (or the professional acting for you) have to reach out to Revenue Canada before they reach out for you, or you may find the situation is immediately more serious and can come with some major penalties. At Tax Mechanic, we’re specialists, we know the CRA, and know how to deal with them.\n            <br /><br />\n            We’ll help you resolve your situation, and do everything we can to ensure your problems are dealt with in a fair and timely manner. “We will take good care of you,” is what we tell clients.

And if you’re on our website looking for help, it could mean you’re floundering right in that opening.\n\n            So just what is the tax gap? It’s the difference between the total amount of taxes owed to the government, and the taxes that are actually paid, collected and received.\n            </p>\n            <span>What Creates The Tax Gap?</span>\n            <p>Many things.  Tax evasion and fraud are definitely a part of it – but regular late-paying taxpayers contribute to this gap too. The gap is created by actions both intentional and unintentional. That includes overstating deductions and understating income, but also honest mistakes in filing and payment obligations, or a plain inability to comply due to illness or financial hardship.</p>\n            <span>Comply, Don’t Lie</span>\n            <p>Overall, Canada has quite a high level of compliance, with 93% of individuals filing their taxes as they should. However, many Canadians default. And the CRA – especially if you try to deal with them on your own –  can be very stern with those ‘naypayers.’ Sometimes they will even go as far as to make a severe example of someone who hasn’t been forthcoming but is now trying to do the right thing.\n\n            Between $800 million and $3 billion in tax revenue is lost annually through offshore avoidance schemes. CRA reports from 2014 indicated figures of $4.9 billion in uncollected GST/HST and $8.7 billion in the domestic underground economy.\n\n            That’s $14.6 billion of lost government revenues, revenue that is used to fund all of our national and provincial programs. It’s no wonder that the Trudeau government is investing serious dough into cracking down on tax delinquents.\n\n            The government committed almost $1 billion in the 2016 budget for investigation and enforcement into closing the tax gap. Their slogan for the crackdown is “better data, better approaches and better results.”\n\n            At the Tax Mechanic, we’re seeing the results of the broadened investigations. The number of clients that come to us after being audited and charged by the CRA is growing exponentially. More houses liened, bank accounts frozen, and wages garnished, and it’ll only get worse. The Trudeau government has pledged even more money this year to increase tax compliance, especially investing into the use of artificial intelligence to make the system more effective- and make it harder for delinquent taxpayers to hide.</p>\n            <span>Your Own Personal Tax Gap – And How To Close It</span>\n            <p>\n            So – what’s your tax gap? Now’s the time to get ahead of the issue before the CRA digs their hands into your file.\n\n            You need a tax expert who will take care of you, and represent you effectively with the CRA. Once you get your tax issues sorted out, returns filed, back taxes paid – and yourself back within the watchful fold of the CRA – you’ll be helping to minimize the tax gap that affects us all.\n\n            Sometimes I come across what I might call a ‘reverse tax gap.’ That’s clients who haven’t filed for many years, only to find out: “Hey – I actually don’t owe any taxes (because I made so little income). And what’s more, I have lots of money coming back from the government!” This kind of good news might be yours, but you’ll never know until you file.\n\n            Whatever your situation is, don’t let the situation get out of control. We can help you close that crucial gap – and get you back to a worry-free life.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P1() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>Everything you need to know about Canada’s Carbon Tax</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\"July 19, 2019\" title=\"Everything you need to know about Canada’s Carbon Tax\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>\n            With the federal elections quickly approaching, every Canadian politician is making sure to give their two cents on the recently instituted carbon tax. One of 2019’s biggest hot topics is the environment, and in particular, how we are going to preserve it. The Liberal’s plan: the carbon tax.\n            </p>\n            <span>What is a carbon tax?</span>\n            <p>\n            A carbon tax is a fee imposed on each tonne of emissions from fossil fuels, meant to help lower the amount of greenhouse-gas emissions. Under the federal tax, oil products such as gasoline and diesel, natural gas and coal-fired electricity are affected.  \n            </p> <br/><br/>\n            <p>\n            In Canada, the carbon tax was imposed in April 2019. The way it works is the federal government gives each province the freedom to impose a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system as they see fit as long as it follows the emission-reduction benchmarks. Otherwise, the federal government will impose their own tax- which is the situation right now in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            The idea behind the carbon tax is it acts as an incentive for consumers to cut back on products and services that rely on greenhouse gasses. To save money, consumers will be encouraged to be more vigilant about their heating expenditure at home, cut down on driving where possible, and avoid other products that are fossil fuel heavy. Analysis from Environment and Climate Change Canada predicts that a carbon tax across Canada will eliminate 50 million–60 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.\n            </p> <br/><br/>\n            <p>\n            The decrease in consumer demand for products in fossil fuel based industries and subsequent shift to sustainable industries will also encourage business owners to explore more sustainable ventures. The government has a similar financial incentive in place for businesses in these industries, where they are taxed on a portion of their emissions, based on how efficient they are relative to industry peers. This protects industrial competitiveness while still providing an incentive for companies to reduce emissions.\n            </p>\n            <br/><br/>\n            <span>How much will it cost and where will the money go?</span>\n            <p>The actual amount of taxes consumers will have to pay depends on the province. In provinces where the federally instituted carbon tax is in place, carbon is priced at $20 a tonne, or 4.4 cents per litre of gasoline, and will rise to $50 in 2020. According to the federal government, the indirect and direct cost of carbon will add up to around $245 in Ontario.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            But taxpayers- don’t fear- the money is going straight back into your pocket. The income accrued from the carbon tax will fund other tax rebates and fatter refunds. The same Ontario household that would be taxed $245 would receive $300 under the “climate-action incentive,” for a net benefit of $56.   \n            </p>\n            <span>The important question: is it effective?</span>\n            <p>This is the essential question that has been debated all over the news. It has become yet another Conservatives vs Liberals argument; the Liberals in favour of the tax, and the Conservatives vehemently against it.</p> <br/><br/>\n            <p>So let’s take a look at some of the arguments:</p> <br/><br/>\n            <p>Proponents of the carbon tax look toward previous results with the tax, focusing on BC since British Columbia has effectively had a carbon tax since 2008. It was priced at $10 per ton of carbon dioxide at its institution, and rose to 30 dollars by 2012. The economy did just fine. In fact, the BC provincial economy grew faster than the rest of the country, while its greenhouse gas emissions declined between 5 and 15 percent. It was widely supported among BC residents, not only for its market-friendly solution, but also because the other tax breaks that the carbon tax allowed. Supporters of the tax argue that what happened in BC should be reflected in the rest of the country as the nation-wide carbon tax rolls out.</p> <br/><br/>\n            <p>Critics of the tax, however, cite other sources to argue its ineffectiveness. The main issue at hand is that no matter which way you look at the tax, it means more money out of the hands of Canadians. Economists from the Fraser Institute argue that because of the insensitive demand for energy regardless of price, a carbon tax would do very little to actually deter people from using less energy. They argue that a $975 per tonne tax on carbon dioxide would be necessary to see through a 30 percent reduction in the use of gasoline.</p> <br/><br/>\n            <p>So it’s up to you: what do you think? Either way, we must face the inescapable fact that we must do something to address this environmental crisis. Whether that’s with a carbon tax or something else, is still up for debate.</p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P1() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>Who to hire to solve your tax problem? 3 things to look for</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\"July 15, 2019\" title=\"Who to hire to solve your tax problem? 3 things to look for\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>You have a tax problem, and it’s time to deal with it.

The key is to look at what profession is most relevant to your problem. Tax lawyers are standard lawyers who also deal in the branch of tax law.

They are very good at doing standard taxes, your basic T1s and T2s, but when it comes to negotiations and going to tax court, they’re out of their depth.</p>\n            <p>A tax consultant or tax specialist is on middle ground with a background in taxes AND a good understanding of tax law and tax court. They are the ideal professional for dealing with tax problems because they know how to work the numbers to save you money, but also tax law so that you can work the system and save on penalties and other consequences of late filing.</p>\n            <span>(2) Big Business vs Small firm:</span>\n            <p>Now that you know where to look in terms of professions, you also want to decide what kind of firm you want to go with. There are a few very large tax firms in Canada, made up of accountants and tax lawyers alike, with thousands of employees. There are even more small businesses, made up of just a few tax professionals within each.</p>\n            <p>From first look it might seem smarter to go with the big firm- after all, they have more resources, more people, and because of their size, have probably dealt with more clients over the years. Small firms may not have the same scale of resources, but they have something more important: focus and attention on your case. Big firms are dealing with hundreds of clients at once, and although they may have lots of resources, they are spread thin across their clients. They simply don’t have the capacity to put all their effort into your specific case like a small firm does.</p>\n            <p>A small firm may have less people, but you can rest assured that those people are doing everything they can for your case.</p>\n            <span>(3) Level of experience and specialization:</span>\n            <p>the third quality you want to look for in hiring a tax professional is their experience and specialization. No fancy explanation needed: simply put, do you want a professional who has been in the field for 5 years and has general knowledge, or a professional who has been in the field for 30 years and specializes in your particular problem? Choose wisely!</p>\n            <p>If you’re looking for someone to solve your tax problem, these tips should help you make a more educated decision on who to hire.</p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P1() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>Is your late tax problem eating you away?</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\"July 12, 2019\" title=\"Is your late tax problem eating you away?\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>Does this describe you? : <br/><br/>\n            You haven’t filed for a few years, life just got in the way. But the more time passes, the more daunting the idea of getting all the taxes filed seems. So you keep not filing. And with all the information online about the CRA sending people to jail and taking away their homes, you become afraid that mentioning it or talking about it to anyone will land you in jail too. So you try and hide the problem from everyone you know, and forget it yourself. But there’s always that fear in the back of your mind, that you know that one day you’ll have to address your problem.</p>\n            <p>\n            If that sounds familiar, this article is for you.\n\n            <br/><br/>\n\n            People without tax problems don’t understand the gnawing stress and fear that comes with having a serious tax problem. For most, taxes are a miniscule aspect of life that pops up once and a while in tax season. It is purely a financial phenomenon such as paying a mortgage or getting a credit card.\n\n            <br/><br/>\n\n            But for those who have found themselves in more complex tax problems, taxes become somewhat of an emotional monster. With all the misinformation out there, the CRA starts looking like an assassin you’re hiding from, and taxes being the crime you need to hide.\n\n            <br/><br/>\n\n            It doesn’t have to be that way! There’s an easy way out that won’t break the bank or land you in court.\n\n            <br/><br/>\n\n            Dealing with thousands of clients with a range of tax problems over the years have really helped us get into the heads of taxpayers with late taxes. We know exactly how stressful it is. We know how scary it is to confront the problem.\n\n            <br/><br/>\n\n            So here’s a step-by-step solution to get rid of the monster lurking underneath your bed: <br/><br/><br/>\n            <span>(1) Hire a tax professional:</span>  \n            <p>\n            When you have a serious tax problem, especially with late taxes, you need to make sure you’re using the right procedures to get caught up. If there are any errors, the CRA can use their enforcement powers against you, and lien your property, freeze your bank accounts, or even land you in jail. Doing your taxes on your own puts you at risk.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            A tax professional on the other hand knows all of the complex rules, and knows exactly how to handle CRA representatives. You know that they are taking all the precautions to get you caught up seamlessly.\n            </p> <br/><br/>\n            <span>(2) Calculate your income and expenses for the years owing:</span>\n            <p>It doesn’t have to be perfectly exact, but you need an estimate of income and expenses accrued for the years you’re filing for. Otherwise, the CRA will audit it for you with inflated amounts owing. If you followed step 1 and hired a professional, they can help you with this step to make sure it’s done properly.</p><br/><br/>\n            <span>(3) Pay what you owe:</span> \n            <p>\n            This is the important part. You need to pay the taxes for the years you’ve missed. If you hired a good professional, they will be able to lower or completely quash the penalties on the amounts owing, but either way at the end of the day paying the taxes itself in inescapable.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            Once you’ve done step 3 – you’re done! All the years you spent with stress eating at you is gone, and it wasn’t even that complicated. Obviously the tax professional will do most of the heavy lifting- if you want to learn more about the technical parts of the process you can read more about it here. But this is really all you have to worry about on your end.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            You can finally exhale, and go back to your life, without the little tax monster under your bed. You’re back in the good books with the CRA.\n            </p>\n            </p>\n\n            <br/><br/>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P1() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>Top 5 Tips to Increase your Tax Refund</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\"July 18, 2019\" title=\"Top 5 Tips to Increase your Tax Refund\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>\n            Tax season. Accountants are stressed, tax lawyers can be heard in the distance whispering about bankruptcy, and everyone else is barely aware tax season is happening in the first place.\n            <br/><br/>\n            But one thing people never forget is their refund check, especially when you’re expecting a sizeable amount. Many of our clients are interested in finding out how they can get a fatter check at the end of tax season, so don’t fret! The Tax Mechanic has an answer.\n            <br/><br/><br/>\n \n            Here are the top 5 things you can do to not only get a bigger refund, but also improve your finances.   \n            </p><br/>\n            <span>(1) Contribute to your RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)</span>\n            <p>\n            Each year you get a certain amount of contribution room in your RRSP to put money in without having to pay taxes on it. It’s one of the easiest ways to save some money for retirement. But the best part about contributing to your RRSP, is you get a sizeable refund from your contribution!\n            <br/><br/>\n            Bonus: Use your increased refund to reinvest back into your RRSP, and save even more money for your retirement. Or go to a Raptors game. Whatever, we won’t judge.\n            </p><br/>\n            <span>(2) Convert non-deductible interest to deductible interest by investing</span>\n            <p>\n            Ever thought about getting into investing? Well here’s an extra incentive- you can get a bigger refund from it too! Interest from investments are deductible against the income earned from the gains. Make money from your investments, AND money from your tax refund.\n            </p><br/>\n            <span>(3) Ask payroll to deduct more tax from each paycheck</span>\n            <p>“Source” deductions – deductions made directly from the source, aka payroll – are deductible, and can get you a bigger refund. This one is easy to do for anyone who employed and already has taxes deducted by their employer. Doesn’t cost you any money or time, but can get you more money!</p><br/>\n            <span>(4) Donate to your favourite charity</span>\n            <p>We need some more charitable people in the world, and if being a good person isn’t enough of an incentive, donations are deductible and can give you a tax credit towards a bigger refund. The children of the world will thank you for it, and so will your wallet.</p><br/>\n            <span>(5) Start a home-based business</span>\n            <p>This tip is more for the entrepreneurial types, but if you’ve been interested in starting a small side business to boost your income, this can actually save you a lot of money in taxes! This strategy converts non-deductible expenses into deductible expenses, reducing your tax liability and giving you a fatter refund check.</p>\n            <p>That’s all!

When I talk to people about it, I get the same question every time:</p> <br/>\n            <p>“Wow! That’s crazy, how could someone not file their taxes for 10 years? What kind of person would do that?”</p>\n            <p>I find this kind of condescending statement funny, because people don’t realize everyone makes these kinds of mistakes. A few of them, years later, ended up abashedly coming to me about the same kind of late tax problem they condemned other people for having! There’s no profile for someone whos 5, 10, 15 years late in filing their taxes. Sometimes it’s simple mismanagement, but sometimes there’s a death in the family, a history of serious medical issues, addiction issues, a lost job or failed business, or another hundred reasons. Make no mistake, any person can find themselves in this situation at some point in their life.</p>\n            <p>I have counselled astronauts, policemen, politicians, scientists, teachers, clergymen, accountants, lawyers, and famous actors. Many of them were well known in their respective communities, and were highly successful. But they were all suffering from the same dirty secret- they hadn’t filed their taxes. Would you judge them?</p>\n            <p>Coming clean isn’t only about overcoming stigma. It’s a serious problem to stay silent about late taxes. Anytime – maybe even today or tomorrow – the CRA can come knocking at your door and double or triple your amount owing. If you don’t want to tell your friends, family, or spouse, that’s fine. At the Tax Mechanic we understand it’s also stressful to get help, especially when many professionals are adversarial lawyers who will cite grave offences, statutes, and laws, or judgemental accountants who will give you side-eye as they file for you. Call the CRA? You might trigger and audit that can cause wages to be garnished, properties liened, and you bank accounts frozen.</p>\n            <p>But don’t stress about it. Lucky for you, there’s an accountant in Canada who not only understands and doesn’t judge that sometimes people get themselves into bad situations, but also has an advanced skill set in dealing with the CRA. The Tax Mechanic. We don’t care about how you came into this situation, we just care about how we’re going to get you out of it. Being in the field for 30 years, dealing with tax court and the CRA daily, certainly helps with that.

The more money you make, the more taxes you pay.\n            <br/><br/>\n            For the nation’s highest-income earners – those making more than $220,000 annually – the amount going to the tax man is significant. Some are left with less than 50 cents on the dollar of what they earn, depending on where they live in Canada.\n            <br/><br/>\n            It is the right of Canadians of all income levels to arrange their affairs – within the framework of the law – to take advantage of all the tax strategies available.\n            <br/><br/>\n            These tax strategies can provide the most tax-savings bang for incoming bucks, especially for those of high net worth.    \n            </p>\n            <span>Make a loan to your spouse</span>\n            <p>\n            To reduce the impact of tax on passive income from investments, couples can spread the wealth around using a loan, whereby a high-income spouse lends money to the low-income spouse for investment purposes.\n            <br/><br/>\n            While it’s tempting to imagine the wealthy hiding their money offshore to shelter it from Canadian taxes, the real – and legal – tax shelters exist in plain sight. Among them are registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs), registered education savings plans (RESPs), registered disability savings plans (RDSPs, for families with loved ones with disabilities) and even tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs). And they’re available to all Canadians, wealthy or not.\n            <br/><br/>\n            It’s just that high-income earners have more cash available to put in these vehicles. The RRSP is the go-to account, allowing deferral of taxes owing on contributed income today until retirement when, presumably, that money would be withdrawn at a lower tax rate.\n            </p>\n            <span>Earn credit for charitable donations</span>\n            <p>\n            For wealthy individuals, donations can help reduce taxes, thanks to a credit (applicable only against taxes owing or paid) that becomes more meaningful beyond gifts of $200 a year.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Generally speaking, the credit almost doubles from 15 per cent in tax savings for every dollar donated (up to $200) to 33 cents on the dollar for money donated above that amount. With provincial credits, the tax savings are even higher.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Wealthy individuals and families often donate larger amounts, resulting in significant tax savings.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Ideally, large donation credits are claimed in high-income years because the annual donation limit is tied to the income for the year of the taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s estate for deceased individuals.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax shelters and corporate tax reorganization\n            <br/><br/>\n            We have provided tax consulting to Canada’s wealthy, including John Di Poce of Alpa Lumber.

Yearly, approximately 5% of the population fail to meet their tax obligations to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS released a study covering the years 2011 to 2016, noting the government loses $28 billion per year to non-filing.\n                <br/><br/>\n                I know what you’re thinking, we are not Americans. As it turns out, there are no statistics for Canadian non-filers. Let’s say the Canadian experience is statistically about the same for not filing taxes as our friends to the South. There are approximately 29 million Canadian taxpayers (ages 19 to 90+).  Five percent would mean 1.45 million Canadians don’t file each year. No surprise that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) invests millions of dollars to find individuals not paying their share.\n                <br/><br/>\n                We have heard many reasons for not filing, or filing, but not paying.  Final results in some cases can be devastating. Some people lose much of what they have worked so hard for. Individuals may choose to ignore tax season and let it pass. The lapse bothers them for a bit of time, then it’s forgotten again until next year. The pattern of not filing is begun, and before you know it there is a big problem.\n                <br/><br/>\n                Recent changes made to the Voluntary Disclosure Program (VDP) have made it more difficult to take advantage of this service. The VDP helps taxpayers who have failed to file for years. Not everyone can take advantage of this tax filing method. It is worthwhile to contact us and find out if VDP is an option or what other tax strategies would be appropriate for you.\n            </p>\n            \n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P6Page2() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>The Psychology of Why People don’t File Their Taxes</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\" April 13, 2018\" title=\"The Psychology of Why People don’t File Their Taxes\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>\n            The psychology of why people don’t file their taxes is a complex, often stress-filled, issue. Reasons often come with strong negative emotions. One year of unfiled taxes with the CRA, can turn into two, then three, and before you know it even 10 years.  Serious problems are created, financially and emotionally, including fear, anger, anxiety and guilt. Whether you are a business owner or an employee, tax filing is necessary and our duty as a citizen of Canada.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Every day, we speak to people struggling with paying their taxes and filing on time. Please watch our video where I speak with a good friend, Jennifer Brighton, MSW, RSW, MPEC, Psychotherapist, Family Counselor and Life Coach. Jennifer’s practice history includes people who have not made their annual tax filing a priority. A Tax Cloud gathers.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Jennifer shares a story of a couple suffering relationship issues, including a serious lack of tax filing, having not filed in seven years. Initially, family drama starts them on the “no tax filing path”, then “tax time” brings a cloud of “life-limiting” fears, anxieties and horrible embarrassment. They realize they could not manage their seven year tardiness in tax filing on their own and hire a new member to their team to sort this out. The stress filled, seven year drama ends with money back from the CRA. A Tax Cloud is lifted!\n            <br/><br/>\n            Jennifer, reflects that the fear of the CRA, and not filing for seven years was a real relationship drama for this couple. Jennifer describes FEAR as False Expectations Appearing Real. FEAR creates a terrifying false idea in the mind that the CRA and filing taxes is an insurmountable obstacle. Not filing taxes can completely overwhelm people and shut them down to the point where they can find themselves years behind. In reality the facts are that there are companies out there that can help.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P7Page2() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>Summer Is Here!

They own a business that has 25 employees, and over the years the company had done very well. A few years ago some health and personal issues changed things significantly. Tax and GST returns were not filed and before they new it the CRA had frozen their bank accounts. The business, their livelihood and their employee’s jobs were in serious jeopardy.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Every week we speak to individuals like Jason and Carol who have had their bank accounts frozen by Revenue Canada. Many know how they got to that point, and usually it is a series of phone calls and letters from the CRA. There are basically four key stages.\n            </p>\n            <span>Stage One</span>\n            <p>you will be notified in writing that an amount is owing. At this point it is a good time to call us. This initial escalation it is not yet reached the “FROZEN BANK ACCOUNT” stage and this letter in many cases might just be ignored… we strongly recommend to not ignore it and talk to us. Remember even if you disagree with the amount interest and penalties will continue to rise.</p>\n            <span>Stage Two</span>\n            <p>\n            you will be sent another letter that will be much more demanding that you pay the amount owning. Again many ignore this letter too, thinking maybe this will just go away. Trust us, they will not go away.\n            </p>\n            <span>Stage Three</span>\n            <p>\n            you might receive a phone call from a CRA agent usually at this stage it is now in collections….NOT GOOD!! …and if you continue to ignore it, comes to the final stage.\n            </p>\n            <span>Stage Four</span>\n            <p>a requirement to pay letter is sent to your bank, requiring the bank to freeze your bank account. If you are employed your employer might receive a requirement to garnish your wages. This no doubt will be a red flag with your employer.

That’s performance?\n            <br/><br/>\n            New Democratic Party Revenue critic Pierre-Luc Dusseault questions whether such large performance paycheques are justified, given the problems at the CRA in recent years.

It allows you to make smaller payments over time until you have paid your entire debt including applicable interest.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Before you make a payment arrangement, you may need to show that you have tried to pay your debt in full by borrowing money or reducing your expenses. To figure out your ability to pay, they may ask you to provide proof of your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities. You may have to do this by telephone or by completing a financial questionnaire.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Some people simply have tax debt and don’t have the money to pay it. Over time, interest continues to grow and the tax debt becomes even more difficult to pay. Some people get behind filing tax returns, knowing that they will soon have a tax debt that they will not be in a position to pay off.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you know that a tax debt is owed or that a tax debt will be owed once you become compliant (i.e. file the required returns) and are just simply not in a position to pay it, then what you have or are about to have is a financial problem.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Trying to make a CRA tax payment plan directly with the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) is dangerous. This is because, in consideration of accepting a short term payment plan from you, they will often want significant financial disclosure, such as where you bank, where you work and where you live. This is in the hope that in the future, when your CRA tax payment plan expires or if you miss a payment, they can use enforcement action on your income, home or bank account to force you to pay your tax debt in full.\n            <br/><br/>\n            We often negotiate CRA tax payment plans for our clients. In addition, we offer a host of other financial resources to those who want to raise the funds to pay off the CRA once and for all or for those who can’t pay and need financial relief.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport \"../../../Sass/Blog/BlogPages.scss\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport BlogSections from \"../../Misc/BlogSections/BlogSections\";\n\nexport default function BlogPage3() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span>Our Blog.</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n        <BlogSections title=\"The hidden meaning behind a CRA Notice of Assessment?\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" text=\"Understanding a CRA Notice of Assessment You will receive a Notice of Assessment when the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) receives and processes your tax return (or if the CRA files your return for you-called a notional assessment or arbitrary assessment).

If you feel as though you should have received a Notice of Assessment but have not, you can contact the CRA to discuss the issue.</p>\n            <br/>\n            <span>What you Need to Know About a CRA Notice of Assessment</span>\n            <p>Just because you receive a CRA Notice of Assessment, this doesn’t mean that the CRA is done looking at your tax return forever. Your assessment will be sent to you after the CRA initially screens and reviews your documents. This is a basic review. You may be asked to provide additional information or documentation during this review process. Once the screening is done, you will receive your Notice of Assessment.\n            <br/><br/>\n            However, the CRA can go back four years and review returns. In fact, if there is a suspicion of fraud, the CRA can extend the four-year deadline and look back even further.\n            <br/><br/>\n            For this reason, it’s important that you keep your CRA Notice of Assessment as well as any other applicable tax documents. These will be needed if the CRA decides to reassess your return or audit your taxes.\n            <br/><br/>\n            You should keep your Notice of Assessment in a safe place. You may need it if you apply for a mortgage or a loan, or if you apply for a social program that requires confirming your annual income. The CRA states that you should keep all income tax records and documents for six years after the end of the tax year for which they apply.</p>\n            <span>If You Disagree with your CRA Notice of Assessment</span>\n            <p>If you disagree with the Notice of Assessment CRA provides, you can contact the agency to discuss your issue. The next step would be to file a formal objection. A Notice of Objection must be filed within 90 days of the date of your Notice of Assessment. When you file an objection, you must explain why you disagree with the assessment and you must provide proof in the form of documents that state your case.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If the CRA agrees with your objection, it will adjust your return and send you a revised noticed. If it does not agree with your objection, it will send you written notice that confirms the original Notice of Assessment CRA sent out.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you still disagree with the CRA at this point, you can file an appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. If you decide to take this step, it is strongly encouraged that you speak with professionals before doing so. This process is often very complicated, lengthy, and daunting. Please contact us if you would like to discuss a filing a Notice of Objection or an appeal.</p>\n            <span>What is a “Notice of Reassessment?”</span>\n            <p>\n            As mentioned, the CRA has the right to go back and reassess prior year income taxes. If this happens, you will receive a Notice of Reassessment. This will replace the Notice of Assessment that you originally received. This document will state the reasons for the reassessment. Much like with a Notice of Assessment, you have 90 days from the date of the reassessment to file an objection.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you intend to file an Notice of Objection, it’s recommended that you speak with a professional first. The process can be quite complicated and the CRA tends to be quite difficult to understand and to deal with. Please contact us if you are considering filing a Notice of Objection. We can help guide you through the process.\n            </p>\n            <span>What if I don’t object within the 90-day period?</span>\n            <p>You can apply for an extension; however, it is recommended to use a professional as it is complicated. As mentioned, the CRA has the right to go back and reassess prior year income taxes and can deny extensions on merits. If this happens, you will receive a Notice of Confirmation and you will have to petition the Tax Court for a remedy.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you intend to file an application for extension or petition the Tax Court, it’s recommended that you speak with a professional first. The process can be quite complicated and the CRA tends to be quite difficult to understand and to deal with during disputes. We have the experience and specific knowledge to ensure success.

rented your home through Airbnb last year to earn extra income, that needs to be reported come tax time.\n            <br/><br/>\n            However, the good news is that you can deduct related expenses;\n            <br/><br/>\n            In a simple context, anything that you incurred to provide that income … you can take an expense for the related cost.\n            <br/><br/>\n            There’s property taxes that apply to both you personally and the room, there’s heat and electricity, there’s water costs, there’s potentially repairs.\n            <br/><br/>\n            For example, people who rent out their cottage for one month of the year can take one-12th of the property taxes, insurance, and heating-cooling costs and expense those against the income they receive.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The profit is then rental income that must be reported on a tax return.\n            <br/><br/>\n            For those who worked as a driver for Uber, that means having kept logs detailing how much they used their cars for personal use and when they drove paying passengers to determine how much may be deducted.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Record keeping becomes very important.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Earlier this year, Airbnb agreed to e-mail the 11,000 people in Ontario who list their homes or other spaces for rent on its site and tell them to report the income as part of a pilot project with the province.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If these companies are American, the information could go from the American company to the IRS, from the IRS to CRA, then all of sudden they’ll know who all the Canadian players are, and they can go ahead and reassess.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Several years ago, the agency launched a probe reviewing big eBay sellers and obtained information on its so-called Power Sellers.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you’re doing business with one of these sorts of

The Canada Revenue Agency has order PayPal, the online payments company, to hand over information about its Canadian business account holders.\n            <br/><br/>\n            On the PayPal website it states it has been served with a Federal Court order to disclose information within 45 days to the Canadian tax-collecting agency identifying account holders and describing the amount and number of payments sent or received between Jan. 1, 2014, and last Friday.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The spokesman for CRA, Patrick Samson says the agency has requested the information to ensure that these individuals and corporations comply with their tax obligations under the Income Tax Act.\n            <br/><br/>\n            He says it’s part of a stepped-up campaign to use third-party data to detect unreported economic activity and identify individuals and businesses that do not file tax returns.\n            <br/><br/>\n            PayPal says it has notified the account holders, adding the order applies even if the business account has been closed.

But sometimes life throws you a curve ball, or two. That means a tax debt that can eat into your savings account. For most, a tax debt and the resulting CRA penalties and interest are overwhelming and feared. But a plan actioned with experienced help can put you back on the track and tax compliance. We have done it many times for taxpayers and it is with great pride that we see the relief provided hard working, honest Canadian families.\n            <br/><br/>\n            To help those who are fearful of a tax debt prepare for their assessment and payment, here is a breakdown of CRA penalties and interest.\n            </p>\n            <br/><br/>\n            <span>Interest</span>\n            <p>If, after filing, you owe a tax debt, the Canada Revenue Agency will charge compound daily interest on that amount starting on May 1. Additionally, they will charge interest on the penalties incurred starting the day after your return is due. The rate of interest charged by the CRA changes evry quarter and is varied by the T-Bill rate. Currently the interest rate is 5%. If you have a tax debt owing from previous years, the CRA will continue to charge compound daily interest on that amount, and any payments that you make will be applied to those amounts first.</p>\n            <br/><br/>\n            <span>Late-filing penalty</span>\n            <p>The tax filing deadline for the 2017 tax year is April 30, 2018. This means that anything filed after this date is considered late. If you owe a tax debt, you’ll be penalized for your lateness. How much? If you owe taxes for 2017 and don’t file on time, you can expect a penalty of 5% of your 2017 balance owing, plus 1% of your balance owing for each full month your return is late, to a maximum of 12 months.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Also, if you’re a repeat offender and received a late-filing penalty on your return for 2014, 5, or 2016 you may be looking at a late-filing penalty for 2017 of 10% of your 2017 balance owing, plus 2% of your 2017 balance owing for each full month your return is late, to a maximum of 20 months.</p>\n            <span>Repeated failure to report income penalty</span>\n            <p>\n            If you failed to accurately report your income ($500 or more for a tax year) this will be considered a failure to report income and you can also face a penalty. If you failed to report an amount on your return for 2016 and you also failed to report an amount on your return for 2013, 2014, or 2015, you may find a repeated failure to report income penalty tacked on.\n            <br/><br/>\n            As a result of the proposed changes, the federal and provincial or territorial penalties are each equal to the lesser of:  \n            </p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>10% of the amount you failed to report on your return for 2016; and</li>\n                <li>50% of the difference between the understated tax (and/or overstated credits) related to the amount you failed to report and the amount of tax withheld related to the amount you failed to report.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <br/>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P6Page3() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>Tax Changes To Small Business Proposed By Liberals.

But they stressed they are not coming after family members who work for the business legitimately. Trudeau said there will be a “simple and clear” framework for families to follow. We shall see.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Regarding reducing small business taxes, it appears now that will happen. Bringing the rate down from 10.5% to 9% by 2019. Again, we shall see.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The federal government is moving to pare down its controversial tax proposal on passive income so that it will only affect three per cent of private corporations. A limit of $50,000 has been proposed but the devil is in the details. Legislation will be required to provide enforcement.\n            <br/><br/>\n            On passive income, the problem isn’t with individuals, but the system, since it encourages wealthy Canadians to keep their personal money inside their corporations so they can receive tax advantages not available to everyone else. These rules are long over due.\n            <br/><br/>\n            However, no changes have been proposed for the Voluntary Disclosure Program which will make it more difficult to qualify, particularly when you must pay all the outstanding tax as a prerequisite.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you are thinking about making a disclosure, do it now.\n            <br/><br/>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P7Page3() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>Divorce And Taxes</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\"October 13, 2017\" title=\"Divorce And Taxes\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>\n            We have had a number of clients who have been or are in the process of getting divorced. It is important to understand how this impacts your income tax, so I asked my business partner, Fraser Simpson some questions about this topic.\n            <br/><br/>\n            David: “As you know we deal with a variety of different tax scenarios, and one of the variables that often comes into play as you know is divorce/separation. Failing to report any changes of marital status can cost you, what are the tax ramifications?”\n            <br/><br/>\n            Fraser: “Certain tax credits, like the child tax credit and HST credit are calculated based on total household income. If you are married or common-law and still file as a single person, you could end up receiving credits you are not eligible for. This could result in money owing back to the CRA along with interest of potential penalties.”\n            <br/><br/>\n            David: “Is there an up-side if you find you’re separated/divorced when it comes to taxes?”\n            <br/><br/>\n            Fraser: “Yes there could be.” “For example your household income has probably gone down and there could be tax credits you weren’t able to receive before. Child support does not count as income to the person receiving it, nor is it tax deducible for the person who is paying it, but spousal support is tax-deducible for the person who is paying it. However, it is important to have the proper documentation to support this claim in case you get audited.”\n            <br/><br/>\n            David: “What about joint assets or income generated from shared investment accounts?”\n            <br/><br/>\n            Fraser: “Most times this is in fact the case and it is so important to hire a tax professional such as us to ensure everything is handled properly. “\n            <br/><br/>\n            David: “What if you still live in the same house but are legally separated.

If you continue to share parenting and financial responsibilities, CRA will not consider a separation to occur for the purpose of administering the Canada Tax Benefit or HST credit.\n            <br/><br/>\n            David: “What about finalizing a divorce.

It Will Be Ineligible For More Than Just Credit\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>\n            Each year thousands of individuals and businesses don’t file their taxes on time or they just don’t file at all. Most people know that not filing leads to a number of problems. Something that you may or not be aware of that failing to file puts you at risk at receiving federal and provincial benefits that are calculated on annual tax returns.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Among the benefits calculated based on tax returns are child tax credits, Ontario Trillium benefits, mortgages, loans, transfer of properties passing through probate and the list goes on.\n            <br/><br/>\n            We have many clients who have been relying on for example child tax credits having them cut off and only because of non-filing. They then have to wait until returns are filed and they are reinstated back into the system.\n            <br/><br/>\n            On top of the problems that come with non-filing there are penalties and interest that will mount. Five percent penalty on taxes owed, one percent is added each month up to 12 months. Interest is also charged, compounded daily.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Taxpayers, for example, who owe $10,000 in taxes would face over $2,000 in penalties and interest after one year. Right now through the Voluntary Disclosure Program these penalties could be waived but changes to this program are coming in January 2018. Watch our video to find out more.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Now most income forms are transferred directly to the government, where computers help determine which late filer to pursue based on their tax recovery potential.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Individuals and business that we speak to are almost always worried about what this is going to cost them. Not so much our fees, that are very reasonable, but how are they are going to pay CRA for the amount owing. We have negotiated on behalf of many clients payment arrangements with the CRA that are affordable and manageable based on one’s ability to pay..\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P9Page3() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>Lower your Tax Debt</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\"September 11, 2017\" title=\"New Rules About Leveling The Playing: Liberal Taking Aim At Voluntary Disclosures\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>\n            Over the past 15 years, we have seen big changes in our economy. The number of Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) has increased by 50 per cent and makes up a much bigger part of our economy than they did in the early 2000s. For professionals, the number of corporations has tripled over that same period.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The average income in Canada is estimated to be about $49,000 this year. An incorporated professional earning $300,000 with a spouse and two adult children can save about $48,000 in taxes by using just one of these loopholes. What that means is an incorporated professional could be taxed at a lower rate than a salaried nurse practitioner or police officer making much less a year.\n            <br/><br/>\n            At the heart of these proposals is the Liberals promise to the middle class, and a belief that every Canadian should feel confident that they have the same opportunity to succeed and benefit from a growing economy. That confidence starts with knowing everyone is treated fairly.\n            <br/>\n            <p>Circumstances Under Which VDP Relief May be Granted Will Change;</p>\n            <p>Currently relief from penalty and prosecution, as provided for under the VDP, may be considered if a taxpayer:</p>\n            <ul>\n            <li>failed to fulfill their obligations under the applicable act,</li>\n                <li>failed to report any taxable income they received,</li>\n                <li>claimed ineligible expenses on a tax return,</li>\n                <li>failed to remit source deductions of their employees,</li>\n                <li>failed to report an amount of GST/HST, (which may include undisclosed liabilities or improperly claimed refunds or rebates, </li>\n                <li>unpaid tax or net tax from a previous reporting period),</li>\n                <li>failed to file information returns, and</li>\n                <li>failed to report foreign sourced income that is taxable in Canada.</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>This list will certainly shrink come January 2018</p>\n            <p>If you are considering filing an application under the Voluntary Disclosure Program, do it now BEFORE the rules change.</p>\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport \"../../../Sass/Blog/BlogPages.scss\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport BlogSections from \"../../Misc/BlogSections/BlogSections\";\n\nexport default function BlogPage4() {\n    return (\n        <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span>Our Blog.</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n        <BlogSections title=\"A Tax Horror Story With A Happy Ending.\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" text=\"Jim had a small business (20 + employees) for 7 years.

He had gone through some personal troubles which had an impact on his business over the past few years. Decisions were made at that time to forgo certain tax payments along with properly maintaining his accounting and bookkeeping records. The end result was some letters and phone calls from CRA asking for information and also payments. Jim had every intention of paying what he owed, but at that moment he just didn’t make it a priority.\n            <br/><br/>\n            On his way in to work one morning he received another call from the CRA.  He chose again to ignore it because he had a meeting to get to that required his full attention. After a successful client visit that would provide him and his staff new work and a much needed boost his bank called. They informed him that they had been instructed by the CRA to freeze his account and any funds in the account to be transferred directly to them.\n            <br/><br/>\n            He thought the past few years were difficult, but in a matter of minutes things got a lot worse. He was not only in for a fight to try and save his business but to save any other assets that he had.\n            <br/><br/>\n            This story is not uncommon and can have many variations but the one underlining thing here is that the CRA will only put up with so much before they put the hammer down! They don’t really care at this point who gets hurt in the process. In their defense they were ignored, and had not been taken seriously by Jim. After these actions were taken, Jim took them very seriously and knew that he had to take responsibility for his actions and resolve this quickly.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Jim found us online and we were contacted. After a consultation with us we created an action plan to tackle the key areas to deal with first. The Tax Mechanic team went to work, representing Jim and negotiating with the CRA on his behalf, getting the bank account back online, getting his accounting records back in shape and negotiated a payment arrangement with the CRA that Jim could live with.

But is this the right decision?\n            <br/><br/>\n            After a few years of taxes and finances, a large number of those business owners are finding that they either don’t have time to manage these parts of their business, fear they might be losing money inadvertently, or worse yet, have gotten a painful visit from the CRA. Many are returning to the more traditional route of at least consulting an Accounting Company like the Tax Mechanic, if not handing off the project to us entirely. If that is what you are looking to do for your business we’ve got your quick guide for picking the right person to help you.\n            <br/><br/>\n            You want someone who communicates well with you.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Obviously, you want a company who knows what they are talking about. The mark of a really great-to-work-with Tax and Accounting company is an ability to translate esoteric ideas and terms into something that you can truly understand and work with. You want someone who will go beyond doing a job for you – you want to be able to use them as a resource, to expand your knowledge of how to run your business. Being able to translate money and tax speak into plain English is a big part of that.\n            <br/><br/>\n            You want someone who can answer all your questions.\n            <br/><br/>\n            A thoroughly prepared and knowledgeable tax and accounting business isn’t just able to answer questions about what he or she does, but is able to discuss your business.

The right company goes beyond just handling your case by the numbers; he or she will be able to answer questions and thoughtfully counsel you on mindful financial planning across all areas of your business.\n            <br/><br/>\n            You want someone you can trust.\n            <br/><br/>\n            We are the first on to admit that we don’t have all the answers however if we don’t we find out for you and get them.

This is all part of a CRA focus on the underground economy that has been a priority for several years, ever since the construction sector was identified as being of concern for unreported income\n            <br/><br/>\n            In a special tax audit, CRA investigators recently reviewed 8,396 municipal building permits, the review identified 2,751 unregistered building contractors from whom the CRA collected some $4.5 million in taxes. Tax investigators also targeted installers who work for hardware and home improvement stores. The audit of 93 hardware stores in 19 different communities found that seven per cent of installers were income tax evaders, from whom the CRA collected some $4.5 million in taxes, $559,000 in interest payments and $843,000 in penalties.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The CRA’s methodology in these cases, is both interesting and unusual: “What we’re seeing is out-of-the-box thinking by CRA that is very clever.” Computerization and data mining are aiding the underground economy initiative. It used to be that CRA had to grind through the numbers manually, but now there is a great deal of computerized data that allows them to deal with tax evasion more easily.\n            <br/><br/>\n            It’s all part of a strategy in which the CRA has increased the use of third-party information to detect underground economy activity. In an email, CRA spokeswoman Jelica Zdero said the third-party approach yielded $10.8 million in taxes, $1.5 million in arrears interest and $2.1 million in penalties in the 2010/11 and 2012/13 taxation years.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The CRA has targeted several industries. More recently, it has resorted to casino audits as an indirect way of assessing individuals’ income and net worth. The Agency is looking at casino records to identify heavy gamblers, then auditing them to see whether their reported income is capable of supporting their gambling habits. If you are reporting an income of $30,000 I would not be spending thousands at the black jack table!\n            <br/><br/>\n            Taxicabs and Uber have also come under scrutiny by way of indirect audit verification. The auditors work back from gasoline purchases to determine the miles driven, and then calculate how many of these miles have been reported. CRA investigators are examining restaurants’ food and liquor purchases, determining an “average cost per meal,” then adding notional markups to determine what actual sales should be.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Even waiters and waitresses have come under the microscope. Several years ago, an investigative blitz involving some 150 wait staff in various restaurants in St. Catharines, Ont., revealed that the vast majority were under-declaring their tips. What we’re seeing is out-of-the-box thinking by CRA that is very clever.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Since the launch of Voluntary Disclosure Program (VDP) we have been able to help many individuals dealing with a variety of different financial and personal challenges to navigate their way through this program and successfully accomplish getting their taxes up to date.\n            <br/><br/>\n            To encourage individuals to become compliant this program was created by CRA and currently has benefits such as not having to file or pay for any back taxes for 90 days giving the taxpayer time to have these returns properly prepared and submitted, for the years that were not filed.  However, coming this January the rules for this program will be changing dramatically, making it, according to the CRA, a “fairer system”. In reality, it will make it more difficult for the taxpayer both in registering for this program and if needed negotiating a payment arrangement needed to pay off a tax debt.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Revenue Canada looking for non-filers using updated technology, backed by new powers provided by Trudeau.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The proposed “draft” Information Circular (we are fairly certain it is a done deal!) is now out on the new VDP rules. The taxpayer must include payment of the estimated tax owing with their VDP application.\n            <br/><br/>\n            When the taxpayer does not have the ability to make payment of the estimated tax owing, a payment arrangement supported by adequate security may be considered in extraordinary circumstances with approval from the CRA collections officers. In these circumstances, the taxpayer must make full disclosure and provide evidence of income, expenses, assets, and liabilities supporting the inability to make payment in full.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If an application is made prior to December 31, 2017 payment is not required.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Revenue Canada will continue to go after non-filers and with the improvement of the tools, technics and technologies being used they will eventually catch you.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you have not filed your taxes in a few years or longer let us help you.</p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P4Page4() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>CRA Aggressively Going After Taxpayers...

This involved approximately $122 million in federal tax evaded and court sentences totaling $44 million in court fines, and 3103 months in jail.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Between 2006 and 2017, 75 tax scheme promoters from across Canada were successfully convicted of tax offences related to tax schemes.

The VDP allows taxpayers to voluntarily come forward and file previous tax returns or correct previous tax filing errors without penalty or fear of prosecution. The tax would still be owing with interest; however, penalties and interest would be waived.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The proposed changes to the VDP were introduced back in October 2016, when the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, recommended that the CRA undertake a comprehensive review of the VDP. In December 2016, the committee concluded that the VDP could be made “more effective and fairer.” Proposals included a framework for tightening the criteria to be accepted into the program.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The CRA is expected to announce formal changes to the VDP in the fall of 2017.

Recently I was reminded of the glass of water “stress test”. Think about how heavy a 10 oz. glass of water is. Not that heavy, right? But the absolute weight doesn’t matter. It really depends on how long you hold it. If you hold it raised in your hand for a minute, it is not a problem.  If I hold it for 30 minutes your arm will begin to ache and feel uncomfortable. The longer you hold it the harder it will become until you just can’t do it anymore.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The stresses and worries in business and work are like holding that glass of water. Thinking about those problems not that often, you can probably deal with it. Think about them a bit longer and they might begin to hurt. If you start to think about them day and night, you will feel paralyzed – sometimes incapable of doing anything.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Being Tax Experts for over 30 years we deal with all kinds of clients just wanting to “get things right” with the CRA and wanting to put that “glass of water” down. Depending on the situation it may take us some time to empty that glass. Maybe at first we can just make it so it is not as full, but eventually with our help this burden can be eliminated.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax and accounting problems can be one of those stressors that at first may feel like not that big a deal but as time moves on the burden of tax debt or not filing can be something that begins to hurt your quality of life. At the Tax Mechanic we do what we do because we simply love solving these problems and making our clients lives hopefully a little bit better and in some cases a whole lot better!\n            </p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P8Page4() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>A $40,000 Tax Bill Became An $8,000 Benefit!</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\"June 9, 2017\" title=\"A $40,000 Tax Bill Became An $8,000 Benefit!\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>\n            Richard B. is a tax client who approached us with a sensitive issue. “Fraser-my sister is in tax trouble-she just got a bill for $40,000, what @#@&% do we do?” His use of profanity underlined his concern. These days, with the advent of computer technology, and the CRA’s renewed determination to increase enforcement, this story is all too common. Richard’s sister, Christine, was a typical young professional, successful, fast paced career and five years of personal taxes overdue. The CRA had arbitrarily assessed her returns resulting in a large tax bill. As the term arbitrary implies, tax returns are estimated, and never in the tax payers favour, then assessed and sent to collections. The purpose of this strategy is to get your attention. A 40k tax bill will get your attention.\n            <br/><br/>\n            After preparing Christine’s tax returns including all allowable deductions, including RRSP contributions, conveniently omitted by Revenue Canada, the result was an $8,000 refund.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you have not filed for a few years, you can expect a reassessment in the summer as the CRA matches provincial data with Federal tax records. If you are in this situation you can avoid the penalties by declaring a voluntary disclosure now.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Do not try an application yourself, one wrong move and you will not qualify for a penalty waiver. We have been doing this for over thirty years and have acquired the specialized knowledge concerning voluntary disclosures and the criterion for acceptance.\n            <br/><br/>\n            We have many stories to tell about companies and individuals that have faced challenges regarding their taxes and accounting.

In other words, they want to make an example of you to deter others from avoiding paying tax. This is the most effective audit strategy: select a small number and pursue diligently.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you are late on filing your taxes, or have unreported income, you can expect a reassessment in the summer as the CRA matches provincial data with Federal tax records.

Partnering with the Canada Revenue Agency to explore more comprehensive reporting requirements so that correct federal and provincial taxes, including income and sales taxes, are paid on purchases and sales of real estate in Ontario.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The province could provide the CRA with information to follow up on capital gains taxes that have not been paid. Through the changes to the collection of the land transfer tax, which go into effect April 24, Ontario will require buyers to declare whether a unit is being used as principal residence and therefore eligible for a tax exemption. Ontario is also demanding to know if you are leasing and the CRA could be armed with information about your rental income.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you are flipping houses or condo’s you can expect a reassessment in the summer as the CRA matches provincial data with Federal tax records. If you are in this situation you can avoid the penalties by declaring a voluntary disclosure now.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Do not try an application yourself, one wrong move and you will not qualify for a penalty waiver.

In addition, the court may, on summary of conviction, fine you 50% to 200% of the tax evaded, and even a jail term.\n            As soon as CRA initiates the contact, then it is too late.

He had not filed his tax returns for ten years and was depositing the money he was earning as a self-employed contractor framing houses, in his girlfriend’s bank account. Recently his girlfriend advised that she had other plans and that he should take his money out of her account. John was concerned because he felt that if he opened a bank account in his name Revenue Canada would garnish his account leaving him destitute.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Going from underground to aboveground is tricky business. Many considerations including dealing with the CRA and how to properly file back taxes. I told John not to worry and that I had filed many Voluntary Disclosures with the CRA successfully and without penalty.\n            <br/><br/>\n            First, I immediately contacted Revenue Canada and registered as a representative for John. Then I filed the ten years of taxes and made a payment plan which was approved on an anonymous basis. Once approved I presented the plan to John who was relieved given that penalties would not be applied. I then e-filed the returns and John was home free.\n            <br/><br/>\n            By the numbers; John owed approximately $10,000 per year, totalling a $100,000 liability. If a penalty was applied it would have doubled the liability. Therefore, by filing a voluntary disclosure through me as a registered CRA rep, John saved $100,000.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you are in a similar situation call us to discuss a voluntary disclosure and you too can save thousands. Do not try an application yourself, one wrong move and you will not qualify for a penalty waiver.

I for one have many of both, and would like to share two of those with you. First a very personal one. In 2005 I lost my eldest son to suicide. A tragic event that changed my life forever. This without question is the worst thing that could possibly happen to any parent and it will be something I deal with everyday, but there is some good news that came from this tragedy. One of those things was the creation of charity and if you would like to learn more please check out our website at cameronhelps.ca.\n            <br/><br/>\n            So I am sure you are asking, “What the heck does this have to do with getting a Notice of Assessment from the CRA?”  Well, the same year of my son’s death I got a Notice of Assessment that stated I owed thousands of dollars from an incident that happen years previously. So began another nightmare of not only dealing with the loss of my son, but trying to deal with CRA on a matter that frankly made no sense to me. My point is this, you just doubt things will happen that will change your life forever, and for me I am grateful to have been able to survive both and move forward.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The CRA battle that I had went on for years, and after thousands of dollars spent on lawyers and having to deal with an accountant that was only concerned about his or her own well being, a settlement was reached no thanks to either. I learned some very valuable lessons. One is you need to trust your accountant is working for your best interests and make sure you understand exactly what his or her intentions are. Also you never know when #$%@ happens but when it does never give up because eventually things can be resolved and hopefully move you on to a better path.\n            <br/><br/>\n            If you have a Notice of Assessment letter or have not received one yet but are concerned there could be one on it ways here are some easy steps to follow:\n            <ul>\n                <li>Don’t panic and give us a call</li>\n                <li>Arrange for a free consultation with us</li>\n            </ul>\n            <p>I have had the pleasure over the past number of years to get to know Fraser Simpson. I have worked with him in business. He has helped me, and still does with my own accounting and taxes. Now we are working together to help our clients navigate not only through taxes issues but other services as well.

He was sentenced on January 20, 2017, to 20 months in jail and was fined a total of $552,976. In addition to the court imposed fine, Mr Wilm will also have to pay the full amount of tax owing, plus related interest and any penalties assessed by the CRA.\n            <br/><br/>\n            A CRA investigation revealed that from 2007 to 2010 Wilm failed to file personal income tax returns to report income he had earned during those years. Wilm received a total of $2,081,167 in income as a self-employed individual which he failed to report. By not filing his returns on time and as required, Wilm willfully evaded or attempted to evade federal taxes of $552,976.\n            <br/><br/>\n            The preceding information was obtained from the court records.\n            <br/><br/>\n            “Our taxes pay for the high level of government services that Canadians count on,” said Vince Pranjivan, Assistant Commissioner of the Ontario Region. “When someone tries to evade taxes, it affects all Canadians.”\n            <br/><br/>\n            When taxpayers are convicted of income tax evasion, they still must repay the full amount of taxes owing, plus interest and any civil penalties that may be assessed by the CRA. In addition, the court may fine them up to 200% of the taxes evaded and impose a jail term of up to five years.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Taxpayers who have not filed returns for previous years, or who have not reported all of their income, can still voluntarily correct their tax affairs. They may not be penalized or prosecuted if they make a valid disclosure before they become aware of any compliance action being initiated by the CRA against them.    \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            There are many factors to consider when filing multiple years’ tax returns and/or declaring unclaimed income. The most important thing is timing. If you contact the CRA and put them on notice that you will file up to date it could save you a significant penalty. However, if the CRA sends you a letter requesting compliance then you forfeit your right to voluntary disclosure and subject yourself to a negligence penalty which is equivalent to the tax you owe. Therefore doubling the amount you have to pay.  \n            </p>\n            <p>\n            <span>Contact</span>\n            <br/>\n            I have successfully filed hundreds of VDP applications with a 100% success rate!\n            <br/>\n            If you have any questions about the process you can contact;\n            <br/><br/>\n            Tax Mechanic<br/>\n            180 John St<br/>\n            Toronto, ON<br/>\n            M5T 1X5<br/>\n            taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            647-499-5693<br/>\n            david@taxmechanic.ca<br/>\n            </p>\n            </div>\n            }/>\n        </div>\n    )\n}\n","import React from 'react'\nimport BlogPages from \"../../Misc/BlogPages/BlogPages\";\nimport Button from \"../../Misc/Button/Button\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\nexport default function P5Page5() {\n    return (\n            <div className=\"BlogMain\">\n                <div className=\"BlogS1\">\n                <img className=\"GradientS1Mobile\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImageMobile.jpg\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"Homepage\" />\n            <img className=\"GradientS1Comp\" src=\"/img/Blog/TopImage.png\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"OurTeam\"/>\n                <div className=\"S1TextContainer\">\n                    <div className=\"S1Text\">\n                        <span style={{whiteSpace: \"normal\"}}>A Tax Horror Story With A Happy Ending.</span>\n                        <div className=\"ButtonContainerS1\">\n                        <Link to=\"/contact\"><Button className=\"Button\" text=\"Book For a Free Consultation Today\"/></Link>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <BlogPages date=\"February 28, 2017\" title=\"What Are My Chances Of a Tax Audit\" subtitle=\"By: Fraser Simpson\" mainPara=\n            {\n            <div>\n            <p>\n            That’s not something CRA discloses.
