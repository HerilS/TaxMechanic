“I had a tax problem that caused considerable stress. To deal with this, I contacted many tax accountants and other professionals. I found them unhelpful, not understanding to my situation and in some cases deceitful. Thankfully, I found Mr. David Harris and Mr. Fraser Simpson at the Tax Mechanic and they were the opposite of what the others provided. They provided an affordable pricing plan and were very professional and above all honest. All of my concerns were addressed and they fixed my problem. If you have tax issues, please look no further than the Tax Mechanic.”
