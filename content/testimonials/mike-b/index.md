“I have used Tax Mechanic for 3 years now and they are fantastic. the process is easy, and I had an unusual situation that resulted in a late filing. they worked with me, and delivered as promised. When CRA assessed at a different result, they stood behind the filing and the final assessment was as they claimed. I will definitely continue to use them for tax purposes.”
