In 2014, a Forbes published article stated about 7 million U.S. taxpayers failed to file income tax returns each year, while 146 million did file. Yearly, approximately 5% of the population fail to meet their tax obligations to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS released a study covering the years 2011 to 2016, noting the government loses $28 billion per year to non-filing.\

Five percent would mean 1.45 million Canadians don’t file each year. No surprise that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) invests millions of dollars to find individuals not paying their share.\

The pattern of not filing is begun, and before you know it there is a big problem.\

Recent changes made to the Voluntary Disclosure Program (VDP) have made it more difficult to take advantage of this service. The VDP helps taxpayers who have failed to file for years. Not everyone can take advantage of this tax filing method. It is worthwhile to contact us and find out if VDP is an option or what other tax strategies would be appropriate for you.
