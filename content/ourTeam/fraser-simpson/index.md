Fraser Simpson is a tax consultant with over thirty years of specialized experience in solving tax problems. In his decades of experience, he has seen the terrible consequences that the CRA’s incompetence and injustice has had on Canadians, from property liens to freezing bank accounts to harassment from CRA agents. It is for this reason that Fraser acts as an advocate for Canadians, vowing to stand up and represent taxpayers to solve their tax problems without abuse from the CRA. He’s been described as an effective, empathetic contact for clients, and seeks to become the leading tax advocate in Canada. Outside of work, Fraser Simpson is an avid marathon runner and guitarist.
