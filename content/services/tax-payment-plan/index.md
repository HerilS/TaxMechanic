# Tax Payment Plan

The CRA has many ways to retrieve the tax owing and the CRA will not hesitate to follow through on aggressive collections practices even take legal actions against you in the absence of a CRA tax payment plan. The CRA can put liens against a delinquent taxpayer’s property, they can direct sheriffs to sell taxpayers’ assets, freeze taxpayer’s bank accounts or they can garnish income.
